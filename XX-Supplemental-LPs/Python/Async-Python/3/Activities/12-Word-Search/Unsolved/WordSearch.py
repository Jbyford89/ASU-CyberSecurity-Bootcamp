# Create a function which takes in a word and then searches for the word within the text

# Open up the file called "Monologue.txt"

# Read the text contained within the file

# Add a space before the word so as to make sure that it is independent

# Search for any instances of the word provided

# If the word is found, count up how many times it appears by splitting the text on the word and counting the length of the list returned

# Print out how many times the word was found

# If no instances of the word was found, print out that the word is not in the text


# Collect a word from the user


# Pass the word to search into the function created

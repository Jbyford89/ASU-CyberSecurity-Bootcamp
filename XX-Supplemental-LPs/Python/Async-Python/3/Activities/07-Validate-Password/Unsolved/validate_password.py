# Define a function called `validate_password` which accepts a `password`

def validate_password(password):

    # Inside the function, check if the password is longer than 6 characters long

    
        # If it is, return `True`

    else
    
        # Otherwise, return `False`


# Collect a password to check from the user
passwordToCheck = input("Enter the password to check: ")

# Check if the password is valid and store result into a variable


# Print the result to the terminal

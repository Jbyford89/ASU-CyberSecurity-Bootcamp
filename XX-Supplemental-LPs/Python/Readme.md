There are two directories for this unit: in-class and async. 

#### In-Class Python

This unit is currently not part of the 24 week program and we do not recommend replacing any existing units with it. However, you can run portions of this unit live over the course of several office hours if you wish. If so, make sure you and the students have the latest version of the Vagrant VM downloaded before beginning the content. 

This folder contains instructor-facing lesson plans, slides, activity files, and a time tracker.


#### Async Python

These three student-facing asynchronous Python lessons can be distributed to students at the end of the program. Remind students to have the latest version of the Vagrant virtual machine downloaded before beginning this content. Please move the files within this directory to Gitlab before the last day of class. 

This folder contains student-facing lesson plans and activity files.

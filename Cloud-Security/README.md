## Homework File: Cloud Security

### Background

- During the last week, you created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training.

- Your lead cloud administrator has asked for a diagram of the Network you created to keep for documentation and company records.

- Your task: Use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a detailed diagram of your cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Recap

When you're finished completing all the activities in cloud week, you should have:
- A total of 3 VMs running DVWA.

- All 3 VMs receiving traffic from your load balancer.

If you did not setup the 3rd (optional) VM, you should have:
- A total of 2 VMs running DVWA

- Both VMs receiving traffic from your load balancer.

You can complete this homework with either 2 or 3 VMs.

### Your Goal

When you are finished with this assignment, you should have a network diagram that shows your entire cloud setup, including your Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM.

This document can be used as part of a portfolio to demonstrate your ability.

### Instructions

Use a free account at [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to diagram the entire cloud network you have created.

- Your diagram should show the following:
    - Azure resource group
    - Virtual network with IP address range
    - Subnet range
    - Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
    - Security group blocking traffic
    - Load balancer
    - All 4 VMs that you have launched
    - Where Docker and Ansible are deployed

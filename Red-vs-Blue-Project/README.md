## Unit  README: Red Vs. Blue Team Project 

### Unit Description

In the second project week, you will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which you will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, you will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, you will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. You'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.

Then, you will interpret your log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that you've successfully performed.


### Unit Objectives

<br>

In this unit, you will be using the Red vs Blue lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP host machine using the following credentials:

Username: `azadmin`
Password: `p4ssw0rd*`

Open the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:

- **ELK machine credentials:** The same ELK setup that you created in Project 1. It holds the Kibana dashboards.
    - Username: `vagrant`
    - Password: `vagrant`
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.100`

- **Kali:** A standard Kali Linux machine for use in the penetration test on Day 1. 
    - Username: `root`
    - Password: `toor`
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.90`

- **Capstone:** Filebeat and Metricbeat are installed and will forward logs to the ELK machine. 
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.105`
   - Please note that this VM is in the network solely for the purpose of testing alerts.
  
**Next Week's Lab Environment**: At the end of 20.3, we will set up a new Azure Lab Environment for the Forensics unit.

### What to Be Aware Of:

- Throughout Day 2, it is important that you take screen shots of each step they complete. These screen shots will be used in their Day 3 Report.
